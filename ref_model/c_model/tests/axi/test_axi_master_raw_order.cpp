// AXI4 read-after-write (RAW) ordering test for AxiMaster.
//
// AXI4 IHI 0022 §A5.3.4: there is NO ordering between a write and a read
// to the same address unless the master waits for the write's B response
// before issuing the read's AR. The AxiMaster must enforce this.
//
// Scenario: write 0xAA to addr 0x1000, then read from 0x1000. The master
// must hold AR until the write B arrives. Failure mode (before the fix):
// AR issues in the same tick as AW, before B — stale read returns 0.
//
// Non-vacuous design:
//   write_latency=6 keeps the write's B response delayed for several cycles.
//   Both write and read are admitted in tick 0 (max_out_w=1, max_out_r=1).
//   The RAW guard must actively hold AR for the intervening cycles; without
//   the guard AR issues at tick 0 and the stale-read data check catches it.
//
// Sentinel discipline:
//   ar_issue_cycle and b_complete_cycle are initialised to -1 (never-set).
//   Separate boolean flags (ar_issued, b_received) gate first-occurrence
//   recording to avoid same-tick aliasing when both events happen in one tick.
