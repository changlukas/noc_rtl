"""Shared packed address-map helper for the sim-side generators.

Mirrors c_model SamTable::validate (nmu/addr_trans.hpp) so gen_test_patterns.py
and gen_tb_top.py compute the same base(dst_id) as the C++ SAM from the same
config file.

FlooNoC-shaped config (sim/configs/*.yml), read by pack_config():
    endpoints:
      - name: "tile"
        array: [4, 4]
        sbr_port_protocol: ["axi"]           # is_sbr() gates SAM participation
        addr_range:
          - { base: 0x0, size: 0x2000000, stride: 0x100000000, space: memory }
    routers:
      - { name: "router", array: [4, 4] }
    connections:
      - { src: "tile", dst: "router", src_range: ..., dst_range: ..., dst_dir: 4 }
Member k of a range lands at base + stride * k, stride defaulting to size
(FlooNoC routing.py:440-449). The member's coordinate is its host router's,
taken from the connection: array index k is X-fast, k = (y << x_bits) | x, which
is this repo's node numbering and not FlooNoC's Y-fast one -- on a square mesh
the two produce the same SET of bases and transpose every coordinate.
dst_id = (y << X_WIDTH) | x.

pack_config() is the twin of nmu/sam_yaml.hpp load_config_table(). Both readers
must expand a config to the same ordered rules;
sim/tools/test_sam_config_parity.py and c_model's tests/nmu/test_sam_config.cpp
hold each side to the same file.
